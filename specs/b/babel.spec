%description
  Babel is a language interoperability tool intended for use by
the high-performance scientific computing community.  Developed
by the Components project (http://www.llnl.gov/CASC/components)
at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Babel supports the
Scientific Interface Definition Language (SIDL) for the language-
independent declaration of interfaces associated with scientific
software packages.

  The Babel tool, applied to a SIDL file, results in the automatic
generation of the associated skeleton and stub source files.  The
Babel user then need only add the necessary code to the _Impl source
files to complete the provision of a language-independent interface
to the package described by the SIDL file.  The languages currently
supported by Babel are C, C++, F77, F90, Java and Python.  

This package contains main compiler files. Conflicts with Open Babel, because
contains another file named 'babel' in /usr/bin.
