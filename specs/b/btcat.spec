%description
btcat is a command line tool that downloads a file using the bittorrent
protocol and outputs its contents to the standard output. btcat streams
the data sequentially, which allows processing the file in a pipeline
before the whole transfer has been completed. It is possible, for
instance, to reproduce a media file while it's still downloading.
