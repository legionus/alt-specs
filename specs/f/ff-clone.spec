What is Fish Fillets Clone?

It is a czech puzzle game for X (Linux). The goal of each level is to
get all (mostly two) fishes out. It is a game inspirated by original
Fish Fillets.

Who has made this?

My name is Miroslav Olsak. I programmed this as my homework for school.
My brother Radek Olk has made most of levels. What is conection with
original Fish Fillets?

There is no conection with Altar (the company which made Fish Fillets
and Fish Fillets II). I have just made several new levels for Fish
Fillets - Next Generation. Program Fish Fillets Clone is written from
the begining, its rules are absolutely different from original Fish
Fillets and even images are mine.
