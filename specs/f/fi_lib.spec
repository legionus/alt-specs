%description
The main features of the library, called fi_lib  (fast interval library)
are:

* Fast table look-up algorithms are used for the basic functions like
  arctan, exp or log
* All elementary function routines are supplied with reliable relative
  error bounds of high quality. The error estimates cover rounding
  errors, errors introduced by not exactly representable constants as
  well as approximation errors (best approximations with reliable error
  bounds).
* All error estimates are reliable worst-case estimates, which have been
  derived using interval methods.
* We only insist in a faithful computer arithmetic. The routines do not
  manipulate the rounding mode of basic operations (setting the rounding
  mode may be rather expensive).
* No higher precision internal data format is used. All computations are
  done using the IEEE-double format (64 bit).
* A C++ interface for easier use is also supplied with the library.
* To get good portability all programs are written in ANSI-C.
