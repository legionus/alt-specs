%description
Inspired by the original News Gothic, which found an eminently useful
life in print media news coverage, the goal of this project is to design
a highly readable open font suitable for large bodies of text, even at
small sizes, and that is available at multiple weights. In addition to
the readability and weight, however, the project is extending News
Gothic's glyph coverage to alphabets derived from Latin, Cyrillic, and
Greek, including the accent marks and diacritics required by languages
outside of Western Europe.
