%description
Icmake is a hybrid between a 'make' utility and a 'shell script'
language.  Originally, it was concocted to provide a useful tool for
automatic program maintenance and system administrative tasks on MS-DOS
platforms.  As we learned to appreciate its flexibility, Icmake was
eventually ported to Unix platforms (SCO and Linux). By now Icmake also
runs on a HP-Unix platform.
