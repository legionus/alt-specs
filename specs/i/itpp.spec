%description
IT++ is a C++ library of mathematical, signal processing and
communication classes and functions. Its main use is in simulation of
communication systems and for performing research in the area of
communications. The kernel of the library consists of generic vector and
matrix classes, and a set of accompanying routines. Such a kernel makes
IT++ similar to MATLAB or GNU Octave.
