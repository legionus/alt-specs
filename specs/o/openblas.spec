%description
GotoBLAS2 has been released by the Texas Advanced Computing Center as
open source software under the BSD license. This product is no longer
under active development by TACC, but it is being made available to the
community to use, study, and extend. GotoBLAS2 uses new algorithms and
memory techniques for optimal performance of the BLAS routines. The
changes in this final version target new architecture features in
microprocessors and interprocessor communication techniques; also, NUMA
controls enhance multi-threaded execution of BLAS routines on node.

OpenBLAS is an optimized BLAS library based on GotoBLAS2 1.13 BSD
version. OpenBLAS is an open source project supported by Lab of Parallel
Software and Computational Science, ISCAS.
