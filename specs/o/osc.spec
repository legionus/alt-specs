* Fri Oct 16 2009 adrian@suse.de
- update to version 0.123
  - IMPORTANT: ssl certificate checks are actually performed now to
    prevent man-in-the-middle-attacks. python-m2crypto is needed to
    make this work. Certificate checks can be turned off per server
    via 'sslcertck = 0' in .oscrc.
  - 'osc list' option -D now only limits non-'new' requests. In state 'new' all are shown.
  - suggest 'osc list' --bugowner option. Not implemented.
  - implemented 'osc ls .' to take proj/pack name from current directory.
  * Incompatible change: 'osc ls' now defaults to 'osc ls .',
  * Use 'osc ls /' if you really want to list all projects.
  * This is meant as a proof of concept. I intend to generalize this usage of '.'
    for all osc commands. Feedback welcome.
  - 'osc in' to be done. Its usage just prints a suggested zypper command line.
  - Incompatible change: osc se now prints Project Package, instead of Package Project
    for easier copy&paste.
  - fix checkout of packages, which contain not committed files (but uploaded)
  - add signing key management command (osc signkey)
  * shows public part of project key

  * added default project to new getpac and bco subcommand. .oscrc:getpac_default_project = OpenSUSE:Factory
    (not added to branch subcommand, to not interfere with its syntax.)
  * add support for generic python-keyring lib, supports KWallet, Gnome keyring, MacOS and Windows.
  * make buildhist command usable without checked out package
  * rename old "platform/s" names to "repository/ies" (internal cleanup only)
  * fixed osc diff -c N, it failed with int and string concatenation
  * made osc diff and rdiff more similar: added -p, -c to rdiff, removed -u from rdiff.
    made -u default for both, renamed --pretty to --plain as it is the opposite of -u

* Tue Mar  3 2009 poeml@suse.de
- update to r6667 (version 0.114):
  - the .oscrc config handling has been cleaned up:
  * use "apiurl" for everything now (== <protocol>://<host>)
  * added aliases support for [apiurl] sections in the ~/.oscrc.
    Example:
    [http(s)://foobar]
    ...
    aliases = foo, bar
    => "osc -A foo <cmd>" will do the same as "osc -A http(s)://foobar ls"
  * "scheme" and "apisrv" are deprecated and will produce a warning
  * when writing a new ~/.oscrc, store the apiurl in the conffile (bnc#478054)
  * fixed bug that made osc ask for credentials when -A was used (bnc#478054)
  * fixed crash upon password entry (first startup) (bnc#478052)
  - osc build:
  * make product builds work
  * speed up by using a cookie when fetching the binaries (bnc#477690)
  * support for VM (kvm or xen) builds

    service instance instead.
  * be a bit more verbose if the linked package isn't expanded (bnc#470948)
  - osc branch:
  * --develproject option fixed (the API calls it 'ignoredevel' instead of 'nodevelproject')
  * --revision option added

    diff use the --pretty option)
  - osc rdiff: the default is to return a pretty diff (to get an unified diff use the --unified option)
  - osc sr show --diff: the default is to return a pretty diff (to get an unified diff use the --unified option)
  - osc getbinaries: optionally also download source rpms
  - osc importsrcpkg: set the url in the package meta (bnc#458083)
  - osc wipebinaries: added --expansion option
  - added support for format strings like "%%(project)s" and "%%(package)s" which
    can be used in the build-root config option.  For example one could use a new
    chroot for each package.
  - osc updatepacmetafromspec: fix failure if %%description is starting with newline (bnc#462869)
  - catch OSError exceptions which might be raised by the subprocess module
  - don't use a hardcoded path for the rpm binary otherwise it fails on
    distributions like debian

    the api server
  - pass the --debug option to the build script which will take
    care of creating debuginfo packages

- update to r4461 (version 0.107):
  - osc update / checkout: *important bugfix* don't check out a
    working copy, or update an existing one, when a source link
    cannot be applied [bnc#409373]
  - osc build: the --extra-pkgs option is now a configurable
    setting in .oscrc.  Default is "extra-pkgs = vim gdb strace"
* Fri Jul 11 2008 poeml@suse.de

* Wed Jul  9 2008 poeml@suse.de
- update to r4401: (version 0.105):
  - osc submitreq list:
  - can now be called without parameters, applying to the working copy then.
  - calling it in a project directory is also possible now.
  - output was improved. Newest requests are listed first.
  - osc submitreq delete: a new action which has been added
  - osc submitreq list/create: use api URL from the working copy
  - osc meta: editing returns the API error description instead of a plain HTTP
    error if available
  - osc copypac: use the correct userid when copying to another api host

  - osc linkpac: --revision option added.
  - osc search: added option -i|--involved, to show in which projects/packages

    architectures that are not supported by the host
  - osc buildhist: change the output into a format which better matches actual
    RPM filenames.
  - osc commit: give commit message tempfiles a ".diff" suffix, so syntax
    highlighting automatically works in capable editors
  - other bug fixes:
  - don't expand/unexpand if the working copy has local modifications - this is
    an ugly workaround for bnc#399247 but this way the working copy isn't screwed up
  - work around a bug which causes packages to be cached locally under the
    "None" architecture (and therefore causing issues when building for more
    than one architecture via osc build).
  - don't create _linkerror files in working copies
  - better error handling (mostly printing more details) in a number of cases
  - show error messages from the API also for type 500 errors
* Wed Jun 11 2008 poeml@suse.de
- update to r4164 (version 0.104):
  - osc update: after update, reset the revision when updating
    multiple package. Fixes "404: Not Found" type errors when
    updating an entire project. [bnc#399177]
  - more/better error messages in some error scenarios
  - osc wipebinaries: add missing check for commandline arguments,
    which could cause a PACKAGE argument to be ignored
  - fixed make_diff in order to avoid errors when committing a new
    package (created with mkpac)
* Fri Jun  6 2008 poeml@suse.de
- update to r4120 (version 0.103):
  - osc submitreq create: simplify by make osc guess needed
    parameters, if there is a working copy and it is a source link.
  - osc submitreq create: don't stop on packages that have a devel
    project defined, if the submit actually comes from that
    project.
  - osc checkout: checkout of source links is now done in expanded
    form per default. The new option --unexpand-link can be used to
    get the raw link file.
  - show the API's error message for HTTP 403 (Forbidden) replies.
* Tue Jun  3 2008 poeml@suse.de
- update to r4089 (version 0.102)
  - osc branch: Show the actually created branch project name, not
    a guessed one.  Add --nodevelproject.
  - osc submitreq: look up the develproject of the target, and if
    there is one, don't create the request, unless forced with
  - -nodevelproject.
  - when -d (global, for debug) was used, save the body because it can't be read twice
* Tue May 27 2008 poeml@suse.de
- update to r4030:
  - version 0.101
  - add osc branch command, using the branch API call to branch a package to
    home:poeml:branches:PRJ/PKG
  - osc commit now opens $EDITOR for commit message
  - improved error handling, when API returns HTTP status code 400 (bad request)
  - osc status: implement -q/--quiet switch

  - make "osc meta prjconf <project> -e" work again (probably caused by r3702)
* Tue May 20 2008 poeml@suse.de
- update to r4002:
  - osc maintainer: new -D/--devel-project switch
  - osc rprjresults/rresults: small fixes
  - facilitate correct syntax highlighting when editing metadata
* Mon May 19 2008 poeml@suse.de
- update to r3995:
  - version 0.100
  - improved error handling (babysitter.py wrapper, oscerr.py exception classes)
    Tracebacks are mostly suppressed now. To enable them, use
    |    -t, --traceback    print call trace in case of errors
    or set traceback=1 in .oscrc.
  - other new global options for debugging:
    |    --debugger         jump into the debugger before executing anything
    |    --post-mortem      jump into the debugger in case of errors
    |    -d, --debug        print info useful for debugging
  - make way for more seamless osc version updates (the .osc directory in working copies
    will have its own versioning in the future)
  - osc rprjresults and osc rresults: new commands to show remote build results
  - osc build: added --baselibs and --jobs options
  - osc copypac: added --keep-maintainers switch
  - BUILD_DIST environment variable will be ignored (bnc#359846)
    The following environment variables can still be used:
  * OSC_SU_WRAPPER overrides the setting of su-wrapper.
  * OSC_BUILD_ROOT overrides the setting of build-root.
  * OSC_PACKAGECACHEDIR overrides the setting of packagecachedir.
  - a few bug fixes.
* Mon Apr 21 2008 poeml@suse.de
- remove the patch added by Adrian (bnc#378421)
* Sat Apr 12 2008 adrian@suse.de
- add patch from abauer to fix cookie handling (bnc#378421)
* Wed Apr  2 2008 poeml@suse.de
- update to r3614:
  - osc commit: implement committing with keeping links (to commit
    changes to expanded links)
  - osc copypac: make the server-side copy the default. But do a
    client-side copy if source and target are not on the same
    buildservice instance
* Tue Apr  1 2008 poeml@suse.de
- update to r3598:
  New features:
  - new link handling:
    add support for handling linked packages in expanded form. They
    can be checked out, updated (expanding or unexpanding them),
    and built locally.
    Missing: commit support.
    Newly introduced options are:
  * osc checkout: --expand-link
  * osc update: --expand-link and --unexpand-link
  - osc build: add --debuginfo switch (Thanks, Juergen!) [bnc#368524]
  - osc req: add option -a / --add-header to inject arbitrary
    request headers
  - osc addremove (and others): ignore _all_ dot files (the
    buildservice doesn't handle them) [bnc#370476]
  - copypac: do a server-side copy (via a single api call) when
    used with -s / --server-side.
  - prjresults: csv export uses ';' as default (Pavol)
  - osc update/checkout: enable to use md5sum as revision id
  - osc info: make it show info about expanded and non-expanded links
  - osc submitreq:
  - implement an 'accept' action, resulting in the respective
    state change
  - when requesting a submit, save the source package's revision
    id (looking up what it currently is)
  - give the user a way to override it, to submit an older
    revision
  - when using show --diff, take the actual old revision into
    account. Thus, the diff is against the source revision of the
    time of request creation.
  Bug fixes:
  - osc mkpac only works when 'do_package_tracking' is enabled
  - do_repos() should work in a project dir too
  - handle mmap failure on filesystems like NTFS, which may not
    support memory mapping when mounted under Linux
  - submitreq show: if the target package doesn't exist, a diff
    cannot be produced.
  - fixed username issues when creating a new package (the problem was
    that the username for the default host was used and not the one for
    that specific apiurl)
  Internal changes:
  - enhance osc.core.makeurl(). This function accepts a query
    parameter in form of a list. The query can now also be given as a
    dictionary, and in that case it will be automatically urlencoded.
    The behaviour for a list is unchanged for the reason of backward
    compatibility.
  - add Linkinfo class to osc.core
  - Package class:
  - add linkinfo when reading in package data via update_datastructs()
  - add islink() and isexpanded() methods
  - added 3 new methods:
  * createPackageDir(): creates and initializes a new package dir in
    the given project.
  * get_apiurl_usr(): returns the username for a certain apiurl
  * get_configParser(): returns an ConfigParser() object which can be
    used for parsing the ~/.oscrc file
  - new show_upstream_xsrcmd5() method which returns the xsrcmd5 (if a
    linkinfo element exists)
  - all necessary auth-information are available in the 'auth_dict'
    (so there's no need to fool around with the ConfigParser...)
  - if there are no credentials for the apisrv in use (which may be
    specified with -A on the commandline), don't try to set up
    config['user'] with credentials.
* Mon Mar 10 2008 poeml@suse.de
- update to r3492:
  - new feature: package tracking. It's not enabled by default and
  needs to be switched on with do_package_tracking=1 in .oscrc.
  before using. See
  http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-buildservice/2008-03/msg00114.html
  for more info.
  - new command submitreq, to handle "submit requests" (next
  generation build service feature). Its functionality isn't
  complete yet. So far it can create, list and show requests.
  - define bugowner when creating new projects or packages
* Tue Mar  4 2008 poeml@suse.de
- update to r3403:
  - fixes from Marcus and Michal Marek:
  - fix importsrcpkg when $projectdir/.osc/_apiurl is an
    alternative apiurl
  - added optional apiurl parameter to the following methods:
    meta_exists, make_meta_url, checkRevision if no apiurl
    parameter is specified the global value (conf.config['apiurl'])
    will be used. This should fix bug #361764
  - some small apiurl fixes in the make_diff method (the
    package_tracking branch already has this fix)
  - added option --csv to 'osc prjresults' to output a CSV table
  - small fixes testsuite for the testsuite
* Thu Jan 24 2008 poeml@suse.de
- update to r3046:
  - build:
  - add --no-verify
  - add --local-package to build a package which doesn't exist on the server
  - add --alternative-project to specify a project, if the current one doesn't
    exist on the server
  - use api url from .osc/_apiurl [#355144]
  - new command remotebuildlog
  - diff: fix #347377 (diffing too many files)
  - checkout: check for project existance beforehand
* Fri Jan 11 2008 adrian@suse.de
- add Recommends: build > 2007.09.14
* Mon Dec 10 2007 poeml@suse.de
- update to r2778:
  - bugfix in build: in order to verify package signatures, run the
    external rpm command with en_EN locale, because the output is
    being parsed
  - cat: simplify the code a bit; don't print header and footer lines
* Fri Nov 30 2007 poeml@suse.de
- update to r2688:
  - fixed bug in osc cat
* Fri Nov 30 2007 poeml@suse.de
- update to r2685:
  - rdiff: new command for server-side diffs between arbitrary
    packages
  - cat: new command to print a file on the standard output
  - diff: reworked functionality to show newly added files, and
    behaving more like svn when doing diff against a certain
    revision
  - bugfix in {link,aggregate,copy}_pac (<person> elements). Patch
    from Michal Marek.
  - checkout an empty project instead of doing nothing
  - fix prjresults for newly added packages, where build status is
    missing
  - internal changes:
  - copied init_project_dir() method from the
    osc-package-tracking branch (just removed the
    do_package_tracking stuff)
  - changed the storedir attribut of the Package() class to an
    absolute filename - normally this shouldn't have any impact
    on existing methods, functionality etc.
* Tue Oct 30 2007 poeml@suse.de
- update to r2467. Most work done by Marcus Huewe.
  - version 0.99

  - do not create dirs for non-existing packages during checkout
    [#259711]
* Mon Sep  3 2007 poeml@suse.de
- update to r2075:
  - new 'maintainer' command, to list the maintainers of a project
    or package
  - make osc call build with --changelog option, by default [#298436]
  - make osc library simpler to use from external scripts, by
    simply calling conf.get_config(), with possibility to override
    conf file, http debugging, api server). It is no longer
    required to set up the api url in the config dict, and call
    conf.init_basicauth().
  - allow to specify a different config file via the environmental
    variable OSC_CONFIG, or via -c|--config on the commandline
* Fri Aug 17 2007 poeml@suse.de

  - build: add --changelog option to force update of the package
    changelog from a changes file
* Thu Aug  9 2007 poeml@suse.de

  - meta: remove notion of non-implemented --create switch. give
    example for meta pkg usage
  - search: add --repos-baseurl option
* Wed Aug  8 2007 poeml@suse.de
- update to r1947:
  - commit: fixed possible "UnboundLocalError" with -m. Thanks to
    judas_iscariote for spotting this issue, and Marcus for fixing
    it.
* Wed Aug  8 2007 poeml@suse.de
- update to r1946:
  - avoid warning/error with unsupported HTTPS_PROXY [#214983][#298378]
  - importsrcpkg:
  * changed default behaviour - the files will not be committed by
    default. To commit them use the --commit switch.
  * added --delete-old-files option switch to delete old files from
    the server.
  * allow to import source rpms by specifying an URL
  * use rpm-python
  - fix for "osc prjconf <project> -e".
  - add Recommends: rpm-python
* Wed Jul 25 2007 poeml@suse.de
- update to r1884:
  - added new importfromsrcpkg command, to import a package src.rpm
    (we owe this to Marcus)
  - added new req command, to issue arbitrary requests to the API
  - append missing newline if do_commits=False [#293672]
  - make delete_package() and delete_project() more userfriendly
    (added trivial exception handling..)
  - expand ~ to users home for packagecachedir in .oscrc [#293675]
* Thu Jul 19 2007 poeml@suse.de
- update to r1871:
  - meta: allow for editing patterns
  - small fixes:
  - fix error message which osc issues if build package is too old
  - results: result code can be empty when package has just been created
  - fix name of 10.2 product in the template for new projects
* Wed Jul 18 2007 poeml@suse.de
- update to r1861:
  - commit (using the currently documented way):
  - do DELETEs _before_ generating an "upload" revision with
    PUTs. The DELETEs would be invalidated by the commit.
  - switch to new commit mode also if the -F switch is used
  - flush stdout, so that the progress dots are seen directly
    when being written
* Mon Jul 16 2007 poeml@suse.de
- update to r1846:
  - added initial search support (some ideas are taken from the webclient):
  * when searching a package/project it
    is also possible to search for the search term
    in the <title /> and <description /> elements of
    a package/project.
  * show only exact matches
  - new meta command, replacing editmeta, editprj, createprj,
    editpac, createpac, edituser. Can either show existing meta, or
    edit it (--edit), or upload content (--file). Fix metadata
    change detection, which no longer relies on the timestamp of
    the temporary file.
  - log:
  - renamed previous "log" command to "buildlog" (short: bl)
  - implementing a log command to review the commit log
  - commit:
  - commit: implemented -m and -F option for the commit message.
    NOTE: if -m is used, osc uses a different mode of uploading
    files and commit them, namely the way which is currently
    documented in the api. So far, osc was uploading each file
    separately through the old backward compatible way. This way
    of committing can also be forced with do_commits = 1 in
    .oscrc.
  - other changes:
  - api now sends HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request for invalid xml. Thus,
    show the reply body because it contains helpful info.
  - if PUT on metadata fails with a 500, and http_debug is True,
    print out the body of the server reply
  - improved exception handling in some places
  - updatepacmetafromspec: read spec files in utf-8, or whatever
    the preferred encoding is in the locale
* Wed Jul 11 2007 poeml@suse.de
- update to r1825:
  - version 0.97
  - added initial revision handling:
  - extended "osc co prj pac" to checkout a specific revision of pac
  - extended "osc up" to update to a specific revision
  - extended "osc diff" to diff the working copy against a
    specific revision on the server. NOTE: comparing two
    server-side revisions (osc diff -r 11:12) is currently
    not supported!

  - wipebinaries: allow to wipe all binaries of packages for which
    the build is disabled
  - updatepacmetafromspec scans for spec files automatically; also,
    added a --specfile option.
  - load subcommands from /var/lib/osc-plugins/ or ~/.osc-plugins/
* Fri Jun 29 2007 poeml@suse.de
- add /var/lib/osc-plugins to the filelist
* Fri Jun 29 2007 poeml@suse.de

    version control
* Thu Jun 28 2007 poeml@suse.de
- update to r1792:
  - linkpac: make this osc subcommand work again: sync metadata if
    edit_meta() is called with change_is_required=False.
  - log: fail gracefully if logfile can't be found
  - handle empty prjresults (e.g. when no repositories are defined)
* Tue Jun 26 2007 poeml@suse.de

  - build: don't stumble over an empty list of packages when trying to verify packages
  - ls: add verbose option to print extra information for packages
  - for ls, co, meta, editmeta, linkpac, copypac, rebuildpac, and wipebinaries

    of "foo bar"
* Fri Jun 22 2007 poeml@suse.de
- update to r1769:
  fix return values in metafile.sync() which I broke whey I applied
  Marcus Huewe's patch...
* Thu Jun 21 2007 poeml@suse.de
- update to r1763:
  - set correct Content-Type header on PUT requests
    (application/octet-stream). Rails 1.2 seems to be more strict
    in this regard. Patch from Marcus Rueckert.
  - init: make usage (and usage info) info more precise
* Thu Jun 14 2007 poeml@suse.de
- update to r1733:
  New features kindly implemented by Marcus Huewe:
  - added wipebinaries command
  - added abortbuild command
  - improved handling of metadata editing if the server doesn't accept it
* Thu Jun 14 2007 poeml@suse.de
- update to r1731:
  - adjust for change in build.rpm, where /usr/lib/build/debsort
    was removed.  Look for debtransform program instead in order to
    determine if build.rpm is new enough.
  - update cmdln.py to planned 1.0 version. The main changes are
    related to points that were raised during employment in osc:
    [#] v0.8.3
  - Fix a bug where errors with passing an incorrect number of args to
    functions in do_foo() implementations would be masked.
    [#] v1.0.0
  - [backward incompat] `Cmdln.main()` no longer takes an `optparser`
    argument. Top-level option parsing has been changed so that top-level
    options for a `Cmdln` subclass can more naturally be defined and
    handled on the class definition. Changes:
  - `Cmdln.main()` calls `self.get_optparser` to get an option handler.
    Subclasses should overload this method for custom top-level options.
  - After option parsing, but before sub-command handling, the
    `self.postoptparse()` hook is called.
  - Add a `version` attribute on `Cmdln` subclasses. If set, the default
    top-level option parser will have a `--version` attribute.
  - [backward incompat] Simplify the StopProcessing/opts.stop handling for
    option handling in subcommands. The "opts" argument to "do_*"
    sub-command functions will no longer have a "stop" value.
    StopProcessing is now called StopOptionProcessing. This shouldn't
    affect simple usage of cmdln.py.
  - adjust osc.commandline for these changes.
  - make startdir a module global
  - add info about usage with the 'nosetests' test discovery tool
  - add tests for commandline options
  - results: remove obsolete code handling commandline arguments
* Mon May 14 2007 poeml@suse.de

* Thu May 10 2007 poeml@suse.de
- update to r1652:
- build: implement -x/--extra-pkgs option (passed to backend and
  included in buildinfo result)
- make filling out of username in templates work again
* Tue May  8 2007 poeml@suse.de
- update to r1644:
  - don't allow to delete projects, as long it is not implemented in
    the backend
  - use new API route for downloading binaries also in configured URLs
  - make deletepac work again
* Fri May  4 2007 poeml@suse.de
- update to r1635:
  - version 0.96
  - following suggestions by Christian Boltz and Michal Marek, osc
    now memorizes where a working copy was checked out from, saving
    the api server url to .osc/_apiurl.
  - implement 'info' subcommand
  - buildhistory works again
  - copypac: implement package copy from one buildservice instance to another
    (--to-apiurl option)
  - build:
  - rename --prefer-pacs option to --prefer-pkgs
  - implement --keep-pkgs option
  - call rpm command for preferred rpms with --nosignature --nodigest

* Wed May  2 2007 poeml@suse.de
- update to r1626:
  - build: implement --prefer-pacs option
  - apply patch from Michael Marek, fixing all places where error
    messages were printed to stdout instead of stderr. [#239404]
* Wed Apr 25 2007 poeml@suse.de
- update to r1608:
  - version 0.95
  - osc is now easier to work with when using alternative API servers. The
    configured server can be overriden with -A <url> on the commandline.
    "apisrv" in the config takes a URL now, so the variable "scheme" which was
    needed in addition before becomes obsolete. For backward compatibility, a
    hostname (and scheme variable) are accepted like before. Likewise, the auth
    sections in the config take a URL now, or a hostname:port to keep old config
    working. HTTP or HTTPS scheme is determined from the URL. Credentials must be
    configured in .oscrc.
  - build: use actual api server in urllist for downloading, instead of hardcoded
    api.opensuse.org [#265211].
  - finally, global option -H enables HTTP traffic debugging
  - implement "rebuild all failed packages", via --failed option in rebuildpac
    subcommand
  - status -v shows all files, including unmodified ones
  - suppress the legend in prjresults by default (show with -l)
  - --version shows the program version number
  - fix the commit subcommand's argument handling. The following works correctly
    now: osc ci ../test/onlyinwc `pwd` fstab ../test/f2
  - fix the download progress meter to work with small terminals [#266989]
* Fri Apr 20 2007 poeml@suse.de
- update to r1594:
  - save and reuse HTTP server cookies, speeding HTTP requests up
    about 5 times (in our iChain setup anyway...)
  - rewrite the HTTP handling
  - adding http_GET/POST/PUT/DELETE() functions, which dispatch to
    http_request(), and use them everywhere
  - removing othermethods.py
  - keeping urlopen(), in case it is used from externally, but have it print out
    a "depracated" message
  - finally, implementing a global HTTP debug mode
  - if data to be sent is large, mmap it instead of reading at once
  - build: remove debug print of tempfile name
  - README: add info about dependencies of osc python module
  - further the osc buildroot configuration example

  authentication)
- add runtime check for build.rpm version, so the rpm package
  dependency is no longer required
