%description
OPAM stands for OCaml PAckage Manager.
It aims to suit to a vast number of users and use cases,
and has unique features:

 * Powerful handling of dependencies:
   versions constraints, optional dependencies, conflicts, etc.
 * Multiple repositories backends: HTTP, rsync, git
 * Ease to create packages and repositories
 * Ability to switch between different compiler versions

Typically, OPAM will probably make your life easier if you recognize
yourself in at least one of these profiles:

 * You use multiple versions of the OCaml compiler, or you hack the
   compiler yourself and needs to frequently switch between compiler
   versions.
 * You use or develop software that needs a specific and/or modified
   version of the OCaml compiler to be installed.
 * You use or develop software that depends on a specific version of an
   OCaml library, or you just want to install a specific version of a
   package, not just the latest one.
 * You want to create your own packages yourself, put them on your own
   repository, with minimal effort.
