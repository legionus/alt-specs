%description
Commander Genius is an open-source clone of Commander Keen (1-6, Dreams) which
allows you to play these episodes and some of the mods made for them. All of
the original data files are required to do so, however, we convienently provde
a store where you can get some of the games including Episode 1, 4 and Dreams
for your enjoyment. There are also mods that can be downloaded direclty.


- About -
=========
So far Commander Keen 1-6 are fully supported. There are some smaller missing
features like PaddleWar, but the whole gameplay is there.

Keen Dreams is starting to work but still might have most of the issues.
So far you can play it to the end. Also the menu lacks of a lot of features.
Please configure input and sounds using the other games.

There is an alternative called Reflection Keen which supports Keen Dreams on
which the code is based.

Commander Genius runs on Linux/X11, Windows, Android, with plans to release
on other platforms in the future. If you think you would like to port it,
please send us a message and we will do our best to help you.
