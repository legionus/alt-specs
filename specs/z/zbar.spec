%description
Zbar is the utils and library for scanning and decoding bar codes from
various sources such as video streams, image files or raw intensity
sensors. It supports EAN, UPC, Code 128, Code 39 and Interleaved 2 of 5.
Included with the library are basic applications for decoding
captured bar code images and using a video device (eg, webcam) as a
bar code scanner. The flexible, layered architecture features a fast,
streaming interface with a minimal memory footprint.
