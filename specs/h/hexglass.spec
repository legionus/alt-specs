%description
The HexGlass is a Tetris-like puzzle game where
10 different types of blocks continuously fall
from above and you must arrange them to make
horizontal rows of hexagonal bricks.
Completing any row causes those hexagonal blocks
to disappear and the rest above move downwards.
The blocks above gradually fall faster and the
game is over when the screen fills up and blocks
can no longer fall from the top.
