%description
The Portable Hardware Locality (hwloc) software package provides a
portable abstraction (across OS, versions, architectures, ...) of the
hierarchical topology of modern architectures, including NUMA memory
nodes, sockets, shared caches, cores and simultaneous multithreading. It
also gathers various system attributes such as cache and memory
information as well as the locality of I/O devices such as network
interfaces, InfiniBand HCAs or GPUs. It primarily aims at helping
applications with gathering information about modern computing hardware
so as to exploit it accordingly and efficiently.
