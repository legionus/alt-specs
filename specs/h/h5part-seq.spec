%description
H5Part is a very simple data storage schema and provides an API that
simplifies the reading/writing of the data to the HDF5 file format. An
important foundation for a stable visualization and data analysis
environment is a stable and portable file storage format and its
associated APIs. The presence of a "common file storage format,"
including associated APIs, will help foster a fundamental level of
interoperability across the project's software infrastructure. It will
also help ensure that key data analysis capabilities are present during
the earliest phases of the software development effort.
