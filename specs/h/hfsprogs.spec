%description
HFS+, HFS Plus, or Mac OS Extended are names for a file system developed by
Apple Computer to replace their Hierarchical File System (HFS). In addition to
being the default file system on modern Apple computers, HFS+ is one of two
formats, FAT being the other, that are supported by the iPod hard-disk based
music player. Unlike FAT, HFS+ supports UNIX style file permissions, which
makes it useful, for serving and sharing files in a secured manner. As Apple
Computer's devices and systems become increasingly ubiquitous, it becomes
important that Linux fully support this format.  This package provides tools
to create and check HFS+ filesystems under Linux.

The Linux kernel does not support writing to HFS+ journals, writing to a
hfsplus partition is recommended only after disabling journaling; however, the
kernel, as of version 2.6.16, supports case-sensitivity (also known as HFSX)
