%description
hunalign aligns bilingual text on the sentence level. Its input is
tokenized and sentence-segmented text in two languages. In the simplest
case, its output is a sequence of bilingual sentence pairs (bisentences).

In the presence of a dictionary, hunalign uses it, combining this
information with Gale-Church sentence-length information. In the absence
of a dictionary, it first falls back to sentence-length information,
and then builds an automatic dictionary based on this alignment. Then
it realigns the text in a second pass, using the automatic dictionary.

Like most sentence aligners, hunalign does not deal with changes of
sentence order: it is unable to come up with crossing alignments, i.e.,
segments A and B in one language corresponding to segments B' A' in
the other language.

There is nothing Hungarian-specific in hunalign, the name simply reflects
the fact that it is part of the hun* NLP toolchain.
