%description
This tool can be described as a Tiny Dirty Linux Only C command
that looks for coreutils basic commands (cp, mv, dd, tar,
gzip/gunzip, cat, ...) currently running on your system and
displays the percentage of copied data.

It simply scans /proc for interesting commands, and then use fd/
and fdinfo/ directories to find opened files and seek position,
and reports status for the biggest file.

It's very light, and compatible with virtually any command.
