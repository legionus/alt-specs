%description
CFITSIO is a library of C and Fortran subroutines for reading and
writing data files in FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) data format.
CFITSIO simplifies the task of writing software that deals with FITS
files by providing an easy to use set of high-level routines that insulate
the programmer from the internal complexities of the FITS file format.
At the same time, CFITSIO provides many advanced features that have made
it the most widely used FITS file programming interface in the astronomical
community.
