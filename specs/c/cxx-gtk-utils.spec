%description
c++-gtk-utils is a lightweight library containing
a number of classes and functions for programming
GTK+ programs using C++ in POSIX (unix-like) environments,
where the user does not want to use a full-on wrapper such
as gtkmm or wxWidgets, or is concerned about exception safety
or thread safety of the wrapper and their documentation.
It is parallel installable for both GTK+2 and GTK+3.
