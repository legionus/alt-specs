%description
Crates is a three dimensional puzzle game. It consists of missions
that consist of levels. To pass a level, you must move player to the
exit by interacting with the different kinds of crates in the level.
Before that you must also collect all the keys and toggle all the
toggles that the level might contain. Every level has a password that
makes it possible to continue playing from that level whenever you
want, but if you want to get your name in the hall of fame, you must
play the whole mission at one go. On that case, the faster you are, the
better is your position in the hall of fame.
