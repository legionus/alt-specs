%description
Coin is an OpenGL-based, 3D graphics library that has its roots in the
Open Inventor 2.1 API, which Coin still is compatible with.

If you are not familiar with Open Inventor, it is a scene-graph based,
retain-mode, rendering and model manipulation, C++ class library,
originally designed by SGI.  It quickly became the de facto standard
graphics library for 3D visualization and visual simulation software
in the scientific and engineering community after its release.  It
also became the basis for the VRML1 file format standard.
