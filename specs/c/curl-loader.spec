%description
curl-loader (also known as "omes-nik" and "davilka") is an open-source
tool written in C-language, simulating application load and application
behavior of thousands and tens of thousand HTTP/HTTPS and FTP/FTPS
clients, each with its own source IP-address. In contrast to other
tools curl-loader is using real C-written client protocol stacks,
namely, HTTP and FTP stacks of libcurl and TLS/SSL of openssl,
and simulates user behavior with support for login and authentication
flavors.

The goal of the project is to deliver a powerful and flexible
open-source testing solution as a real alternative to Spirent 
Avalanche and IXIA IxLoad.
