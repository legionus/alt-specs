%description
The Aalto XML processor is a StAX XML processor implementation. It
is not directly related to other existing mature implementations
(such as Woodstox or Sun Java Streaming XML Parser), although it
did come about as a prototype for evaluating implementation strategies
that differ from those traditionally used for Java-based parsers.

Two main goals (above and beyond stock StAX/SAX API implementation) are:

A. Ultra-high performance parsing by making the Common Case Fast
  (similar to original RISC manifesto). This may mean limiting
  functionality, but never compromising correctness. XML 1.0
  compliance is not sacrificed for speed.

A. Allowing non-block, asynchronous parsing: it should be possible to
  "feed" more input and incrementally get more XML events out, without
  forcing the current thread to block on I/O read operation.
