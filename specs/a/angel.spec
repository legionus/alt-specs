%description
ANGEL stands for Automatic differentiation Nested Graph Elimination
Library. It implements graph elimination techniques in order to find the
cheapest accumulation of Jacobian matrices. It provides:

* Sparse representation of c-graphs and their dual line graphs including
  many helper functions to work with them
* Vertex, edge, and face elimination

* Structured graph generator
* Heuristics for selecting next vertex, edge or face to eliminate

  * Lowest Markowitz degree first
  * Lowest relative Markowitz degree first
  * Minimal Fill-in
  * Maximal overall path length reduction
  * Maximal overall Markowitz degree reduction
  * Lowest Markowitz minimal damage
  * Scarcity-aware edge eliminations

* Stochastic methods

  * It is intended to optimize elimination sequences but written as
    universally as possible and can be applied to any problem where
    neighborhood relation and objective function are provided as functor
  * Metropolis with fixed temperature
  * Metropolis with fixed temperature
