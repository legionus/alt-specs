%description
This package contains a cronjob to regularly perform
"apt-get autoclean" which cleans up apt's cache but only removes
package files that can no longer be downloaded, and are largely
useless.  This allows a cache to be maintained over a long period
without it growing out of control.

The configuration option APT::Clean-Installed will prevent
installed packages from being erased if it is set to off.
