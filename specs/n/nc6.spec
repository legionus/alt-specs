%description
The nc6 package contains Netcat6 (the program is actually nc6), a simple
utility for reading and writing data across network connections, using
the TCP or UDP protocols. Netcat6 is intended to be a reliable back-end
tool which can be used directly or easily driven by other programs and
scripts.  Netcat is also a feature-rich network debugging and
exploration tool, since it can create many different connections and
has many built-in capabilities.

You may want to install the netcat6 package if you are administering a
network and you'd like to use its debugging and network exploration
capabilities.
