# <https://bugzilla.altlinux.org/show_bug.cgi?id=31576>:
# maybe this bug requires more investigation to understand
# who goes crazy: a GHC lib or glibc,
# but now we simply work-around it:
Requires: glibc-gconv-modules

# The installed Haskell libs will be processed:
PreReq: haskell-filetrigger
# <https://www.altlinux.org/RPM_Macros_Packaging_Policy>:
Requires: rpm-build-haskell >= 1-alt26
# (rpm-build-haskell-1-alt26 has been adapted to allow builds
# of Haskell modules without ghcN.N.N-common.)

# Build with the same version, previous release.
BuildPreReq: ghc7.6.1-common

# Generally, this could work with APT, after the "ghc" pseudo-package
# is brought back through Provides (allowing to rebuild this package in
# different environments):
#
# <https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/Building/Preparation/Tools>:
# In general, we support building with the previous 2 major releases, e.g.:
#BuildPreReq: ghc >= 7.2
# Newer GHC may be incompatible with the code of the current GHC:
#BuildPreReq: ghc <= %version

# Automatically added by buildreq on Fri Apr 26 2013

%description
Haskell is a standard lazy functional programming language; the
current language version is Haskell 98, agreed in December 1998.

GHC is a state-of-the-art programming suite for Haskell.  Included is
an optimising compiler generating good code for a variety of
platforms, together with an interactive system for convenient, quick
development.  The distribution includes space and time profiling
facilities, a large collection of libraries, and support for various
language extensions, including concurrency, exceptions, and foreign
language interfaces (C, C++, whatever).

A wide variety of Haskell related resources (tutorials, libraries,
specifications, documentation, compilers, interpreters, references,
contact information, links to research groups) are available from the
Haskell home page at <http://www.haskell.org/>.

%description common
Install this package to select %version as the default version
of Glasgow Haskell Compiler.

It will provide the common names for the GHC executables
(like unversioned /usr/bin/ghc).

And it will make rpm-build-haskell use this version of GHC for
building other Haskell packages
(if their .spec refers to %%ghc_version and %%_ghclibdir).

%description -n rpm-macros-%{name}-common
Set of RPM macros for packaging %name-based applications for ALT Linux.
Install this package if you want to create RPM packages that use %name.

%changelog
* Wed Oct 21 2015 Ivan Zakharyaschev <imz@altlinux.org> 7.6.1-alt6.1
- "ghc-pkg recache" went crazy without glibc-gconv-modules (ALT#31576);
  we workaround it for now without an investigation whether it's a Haskell
  lib or glibc which goes crazy.
- Rearranged Reqs/Provs to make them more clear and to prepare for
  independent co-existence of several versions; not yet ready to make
  ghc7.6.1-common optional (it should be installed only to select the
  default GHC).

* Tue Oct 20 2015 Ivan Zakharyaschev <imz@altlinux.org> 7.6.1-alt6
- Simplified the packaging of ghc7.6.1-common.

* Sun Apr 28 2013 Dmitry V. Levin <ldv@altlinux.org> 7.6.1-alt5
- Added libffi-devel runtime requirement because ghc now
  unconditionally adds -lffi to linker options.

* Sat Apr 27 2013 Dmitry V. Levin <ldv@altlinux.org> 7.6.1-alt4
- Reintroduced libgmp-devel runtime requirement.

* Fri Apr 26 2013 Dmitry V. Levin <ldv@altlinux.org> 7.6.1-alt3
- Changed ghc defaults to use -fasm instead of -llvm.
- Built ghc using gcc instead of llvm.
- Fixed documentation packaging.
- Built with system libffi.
- Updated build dependencies.

* Fri Nov 30 2012 Denis Smirnov <mithraen@altlinux.ru> 7.6.1-alt2
- rebuild with ghc 7.6.1

* Sun Oct 07 2012 Denis Smirnov <mithraen@altlinux.ru> 7.6.1-alt1
- bootstrap build
