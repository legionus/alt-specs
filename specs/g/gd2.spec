%description
Gd is a graphics library.  It allows your code to quickly draw images
complete with lines, arcs, text, multiple colors, cut and paste from
other images, and flood fills, and write out the result as a PNG or
JPEG file.  This is particularly useful in World Wide Web applications,
where PNG and JPEG are two of the formats accepted for inline images
by most browsers.

Gd is not a paint program.  If you are looking for a paint program, you
are looking in the wrong place.  If you are not a programmer, you are
looking in the wrong place, unless you are installing a required
library in order to run an application.

Gd does not provide for every possible desirable graphics operation.
It is not necessary or desirable for Gd to become a kitchen-sink
graphics package, but version 2.0 does include most frequently
requested features, including both truecolor and palette images,
resampling (smooth resizing of truecolor images) and so forth.
