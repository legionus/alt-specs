%description
TalkSoup is a GNUstep IRC client with a minimalistic feel and by far one
of the most extensible designs in existence.

At the core is just a simple class which passes messages between bundles
or plugins. The rest of the IRC client is formed entirely by these
bundles. This means you can have multiple output bundles such as a GTK
output bundle, GNUstep bundle, even a ncurses bundle! And all of these
could use other bundles which can do everything from output your
incoming messages through a speech program or filter all your outgoing
messages through a spell checking bundle.
