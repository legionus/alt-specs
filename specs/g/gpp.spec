%description
GPP is a general-purpose preprocessor with customizable syntax, suitable
for a wide range of preprocessing tasks. Its independence from any one
programming language makes it much more versatile than the C
preprocessor (cpp), while its syntax is lighter and more flexible than
that of GNU m4. There are built-in macros for use with C/C++, LaTeX,
HTML, XHTML, and Prolog files.

GPP is Free Software. It is distributed under the terms of the GNU
Lesser General Public Licence.
