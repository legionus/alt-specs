%description
This is a plug-in that lets you interact with Gimp image attachments (often
known as "parasites"). You can list them, view the contents of any that
contain text, create new ones, delete or edit existing ones, load one from a
file, or write one to a file. You can also attach a color profile to an image
(which will be saved by the .tiff format) if you have the .icc file.
