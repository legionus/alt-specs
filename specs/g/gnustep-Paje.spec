%description
Paje is an interactive and scalable trace-based visualization tool which
can be used for a large variety of visualizations including performance
monitoring of parallel applications, monitoring the execution of
processors in a large scale PC cluster or representing the behavior of
distributed applications.

Users of Paje can tailor the visualization to their needs, without
having to know any insight nor to modify any component of Paje. This can
be done by defining the type hierarchy of objects to be visualized as
well as how these objects should be visualized. This feature allows the
use of Paje for a wide variety of visualizations such as the use of
resources by applications in a large-size cluster or the behavior of
distributed Java applications.
