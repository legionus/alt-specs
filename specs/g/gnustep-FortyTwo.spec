%description
FT is a generic, native graph management system for GNUstep and Cocoa
and is written in Objective-C. With FT you can persistently manage
graphs consisting of nodes and edges. Each node may provide so-called
services. Such a service may be e.g. a dictionary services, which all
nodes provide at present. This service allows the storage of any data in
a node and is based on keys which uniquely identify content within a
dictionary.
