%description
GNOME Mastermind is a little Mastermind? game for linux that I've
written, mainly for fun, while I was learning some programming with gtk
and cairo. At first I was not intentioned to share it, but now I think
it has become quite stable so I decided to distribute it. I like it and
I hope someone else would like it too.

The goal of this game is to break a hidden color code following the hints
that the game gives us. Check the game manual for a better explanation
about how the game works and is played.
