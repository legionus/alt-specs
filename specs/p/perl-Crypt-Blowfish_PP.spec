%description
The Crypt::Blowfish_PP module provides for users to use the Blowfish encryption
algorithm in perl. The implementation is entirely Object Oriented, as there is
quite a lot of context inherent in making blowfish as fast as it is. The key is
anywhere between 64 and 448 bits (8 and 56 bytes), and should be passed as a
packed string. The transformation itself is a 16-round Feistel Network, and
operates on a 64 bit block.
