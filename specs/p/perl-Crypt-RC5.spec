%description
RC5 is a fast block cipher designed by Ronald Rivest for RSA Data Security (now RSA Security) in 1994. It is a parameterized algorithm with a variable block size, a variable key size, and a variable number of rounds. This particular implementation is 32 bit. As such, it is suggested that a minimum of 12 rounds be performed.

Core logic based on "RC5 in 6 lines of perl" at http://www.cypherspace.org
