%description
The zc.configuration package used to provide the exclude directive for
inhibiting configuration. It was included in the zope.configuration and
this package currently provides a backward-compatibility imports and
tests that ensure that it will work for people who are already using
zc.configuration and not the newer zope.configuration.

This package may contain more configuration extensions in future, but
currently, it's not useful anymore as the only feature it provided, the
exclude directive was merged into the original zope.configuration
package.
