%description
trustme is a tiny Python package that does one thing: it gives you a
fake certificate authority (CA) that you can use to generate fake TLS
certs to use in your tests. Well, technically they're real certs,
they're just signed by your CA, which nobody trusts. But you can trust
it. Trust me.
