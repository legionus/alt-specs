%description
Kid is a simple template language for XML based vocabularies written
in Python. It was spawned as a result of a kinky love triangle between
XSLT, TAL, and PHP. We believe many of the best features of these
languages live on in Kid with much of the limitations and complexity
stamped out (see WhatsBorrowed and WhatsDifferent). For more info on
current and planned features and licensing information, see AboutKid.
