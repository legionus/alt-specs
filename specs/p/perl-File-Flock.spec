%description
Lock files using the flock() call.  If the file to be locked does not
exist, then the file is created.  If the file was created then it will
be removed when it is unlocked assuming it's still an empty file.

Locks can be created by new'ing a File::Flock object.  Such locks
are automatically removed when the object goes out of scope.  The
unlock() method may also be used.

lock_rename() is used to tell File::Flock when a file has been
renamed (and thus the internal locking data that is stored based
on the filename should be moved to a new name).  unlock() the
new name rather than the original name.
