%description
*Data::Buffer* implements a low-level binary buffer in which
you can get and put integers, strings, and other data.
Internally the implementation is based on "pack" and "unpack",
such that *Data::Buffer* is really a layer on top of those
built-in functions.

All of the *get_** and *put_** methods respect the
internal offset state in the buffer object. This means that
you should read data out of the buffer in the same order that
you put it in. For example:

    $buf->put_int16(24);
    $buf->put_int32(1233455);
    $buf->put_int16(99);

    $buf->get_int16;   # 24
    $buf->get_int32;   # 1233455
    $buf->get_int16;   # 99

Of course, this assumes that you *know* the order of the data
items in the buffer. If your setup is such that your sending
and receiving processes won't necessarily know what's inside
the buffers they receive, take a look at the *TEMPLATE USAGE*
section.
