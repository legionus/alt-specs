%description
This module in an fully object-oriented implementation of a simple
n-ary tree. It is built upon the concept of parent-child relationships,
so therefore every Tree::Simple object has both a parent and a set
of children (who themselves may have children, and so on). Every
Tree::Simple object also has siblings, as they are just the children of
their immediate parent.

It is can be used to model hierarchal information such as a file-system,
the organizational structure of a company, an object inheritance
hierarchy, versioned files from a version control system or even an
abstract syntax tree for use in a parser. It makes no assumptions as
to your intended usage, but instead simply provides the structure and
means of accessing and traversing said structure.

This module uses exceptions and a minimal Design By Contract style. All
method arguments are required unless specified in the documentation,
if a required argument is not defined an exception will usually be
thrown. Many arguments are also required to be of a specific type, for
instance the $parent argument to the constructor must be a Tree::Simple
object or an object derived from Tree::Simple, otherwise an exception
is thrown. This may seems harsh to some, but this allows me to have
the confidence that my code works as I intend, and for you to enjoy the
same level of confidence when using this module. Note however that this
module does not use any Exception or Error module, the exceptions are
just strings thrown with "die".

I consider this module to be production stable, it is based on a module
which has been in use on a few production systems for approx. 2 years
now with no issue. The only difference is that the code has been cleaned
up a bit, comments added and the thorough tests written for its public
release. I am confident it behaves as I would expect it to, and is (as
far as I know) bug-free. I have not stress-tested it under extreme duress,
but I don't so much intend for it to be used in that type of situation. If
this module cannot keep up with your Tree needs, i suggest switching to
one of the modules listed in the "OTHER TREE MODULES" section below.
