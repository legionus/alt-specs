%description
RFC 1924 describes a compact, fixed-size representation of IPv6
addresses which uses a base 85 number system.  This module handles
some of the uglier details of it.

The base 85 numbers (from 0 to 84) are as follows:

    0..9 A..Z a..z ! # $ %% & ( ) * + - ; < = > ? @ ^ _ ` { | } ~

At the moment, there's not much in this module.  But it should be
sufficient for the purposes of RFC 1924.

This module has a variable called $Math::Base85::base85_digits,
which is a string containing the digits of the base 85 alphabet
from lowest (0) to highest (~), in that order.

Additionally, the following two functions are defined for general
use.  (They will be exported upon request.)
