%description
Allows for code to specify channels for delivery of logging messages,
and for users of the code to control the delivery and formatting of
the messages.

Yes, this is yet another logging module.  Some differences between
Log::Channel and other logging packages:

* Log::Channel does not define a strict classification of logging "levels"
(debug, info, warn, crit, etc.).  You may define a priority for a channel
using set_priority(), but this is optional, and you can name your priority
levels anything you want.

* Able to take over carp and croak events from other modules and route the
output according to the Log::Channel configuration.
