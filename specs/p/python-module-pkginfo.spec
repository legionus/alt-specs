This package provides an API for querying the distutils metadata written
in the PKG-INFO file inside a source distriubtion (an sdist) or a binary
distribution (e.g., created by running bdist_egg). It can also query the
EGG-INFO directory of an installed distribution, and the *.egg-info
stored in a "development checkout" (e.g, created by running setup.py
develop).
