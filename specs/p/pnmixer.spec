%description
PNMixer is a simple mixer application designed to run in your system
tray. It integrates nicely into desktop environments that don't have
a panel that supports applets and therefore can't run a mixer applet.
In particular it's been used quite a lot with fbpanel and tint2, but
should run fine in any system tray.

PNMixer is designed to work on systems that use ALSA for sound
management.
Any other sound driver like OSS or FFADO are currently not supported
(patches welcome). There is no *official* PulseAudio support
at the moment, but it seems that PNMixer behaves quite well anyway when
PA is running.
Feel free to try and to give some feedback.
