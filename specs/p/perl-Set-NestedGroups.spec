%description
Set::NestedGroups gives an implementation of nested groups,
access control lists (ACLs) would be one example of
nested groups.

For example, if Joe is a Manager, and Managers have access to payroll,
you can create an ACL which implements these rules, then ask the ACL
if Joe has access to payroll.

Another example, you may wish to track which city, state and country
people are in, by adding people to cities, cities to states, and states
to countries.
