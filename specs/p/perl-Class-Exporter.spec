%description
This module makes it much easier to make a module have a hybrid object/method
interface similar to the one of CGI.pm. You can take any old module that has
an object- oriented interface and convert it to have a hybrid interface by
simply adding "use base 'Class::Exporter'" to your code.

This package allows you to export object methods. It supports "import()",
@EXPORT and @EXPORT_OK and not a whole lot else. Each package into
which your object methods are imported gets its own instance of the object.
This ensures that there are no interaction effects between multiple packages
that use your object.
