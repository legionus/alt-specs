%description
Perl module Statistics::CaseResampling provides a way to calculate
the median (or in principle also other statistics) with confidence
intervals on a sample. To do that, it uses a technique called
bootstrapping. In a nutshell, it resamples the sample a lot of
times and for each resample, it calculates the median. From the
distribution of medians, it then calculates the confidence limits.

In order to implement the confidence limit calculation, various
other functions had to be implemented efficiently (both
algorithmically efficient and done in C). These functions may be
useful in their own right and are thus exposed to Perl. 
Most notably, this exposes a median (and general selection)
algorithm that works in linear time as opposed to the trivial
implementation that requires O(n*log(n)).
