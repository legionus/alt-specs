%description
This data is current as of November 2004. At that time, the publisher
codes  9990000-9999999 or 999000-999999 had not been fixed, although
they had been proposed. I do not include them in the data.

Business::ISBN uses this "data pack" to do its work.  You can update
Business::ISBN::Data independently of the main module as the various
ISBN organizations assign new publisher codes.  The ISBN agency lists
these data at http://www.isbn-international.org/identifiers.html . The
distribution should include the kludegy script I used to extract the
data and format the data structure.

Note, that as a historical artifact, some countries are actaully
language areas. For instance, country code 2 is "French", and includes
several French-speaking countries.

Simply install this module over the previous version.  The module is
a Perl data structure, so you can install it with CPAN.pm, or simply
copy it to the right location.

Older versions of this module did not declare a version, and will work
with whatever version of Business::ISBN you have despite anything the
Makefile.PL might say.

If you make updates, please send them to me so I can include them in
future releases.
