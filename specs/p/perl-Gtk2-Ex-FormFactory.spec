%description
This is a framework which tries to make building complex GUI's easy, by
offering these two main features:

  * Consistent looking GUI without the need to code resp. tune
    each widget by hand. Instead you declare the structure of your
    GUI, connect it to the data of your program (which should be
    a well defined set of objects) and control how this structure
    is transformed into a specific layout in a very generic way.

  * Automatically keep widget and object states in sync (in both
    directions), even with complex data structures with a lot of
    internal dependencies, object nesting etc.

This manpage describes the facilities of Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory objects
which are only a small part of the whole framework. To get a full
introduction and overview of how this framework works refer to
Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory::Intro.
