%description
The ``peak.util.extremes`` module provides a production-quality implementation
of the ``Min`` and ``Max`` objects from PEP 326.  While PEP 326 was rejected
for inclusion in the language or standard library, the objects described in it
are useful in a variety of applications.  In PEAK, they have been used to
implement generic functions (in RuleDispatch and PEAK-Rules), as well as to
handle scheduling and time operations in the Trellis.  Because this has led to
each project copying the same code, we've now split the module out so it can
be used independently.
