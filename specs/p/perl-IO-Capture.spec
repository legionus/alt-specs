%description
The "IO::Capture" Module defines an abstract base class that can be
used to build modules that capture output being sent on a filehandle
such as STDOUT or STDERR.

Several modules that come with the distribution do just that.
I.e., Capture STDOUT and STDERR.   Also see James Keenan's
"IO::Capture::Stdout::Extended" on CPAN.

See IO::Capture::Overview for a
discussion of these modules and examples of how to build a module to
sub-class from "IO::Capture" yourself.   If after reading the overview,
you would like to build a class from "IO::Capture", look here for
details on the internals.
