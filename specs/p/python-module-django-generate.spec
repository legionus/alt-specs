%description
django-generate adds a management command called generate which allows
you to create objects from a dynamically created JSON description of
said objects. It's primary focus is to generate test content for use
during project development and testing. Objects are only created once
via Django's get_or_create method. Inheritance base model objects are
created where needed. File fields can also be populated from arbitrary
resources. In this way django-generate simplifies generating complex
objects when compared to Django's built in fixtures feature.
