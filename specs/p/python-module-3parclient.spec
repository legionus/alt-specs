%description
This is a Client library that can talk to the HPE 3PAR Storage array.
The 3PAR storage array has a REST web service interface and a command
line interface. This client library implements a simple interface
for talking with either interface, as needed. The python Requests
library is used to communicate with the REST interface.
The python paramiko library is used to communicate with
the command line interface over an SSH connection.

The HP 3PAR Rest Client (hp3parclient) is now considered deprecated.
