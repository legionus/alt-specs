%description
Persistent queues are simply queues that are optimized for persistency
via the ZODB. They assume that the ZODB is using MVCC to avoid read
conflicts. They attempt to resolve write conflicts so that transactions
that add and remove objects simultaneously are merged, unless the
transactions are trying to remove the same value from the queue.

An important characteristic of these queues is that they do not expect
to hold more than one reference to any given equivalent item at a time.
For instance, some of the conflict resolution features will not perform
desirably if it is reasonable for your application to hold two copies of
the string "hello" within the same queue at once.
