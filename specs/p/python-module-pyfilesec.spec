%description
pyFileSec provides robust yet easy-to-use tools for working with files
that may contain sensitive information. The aim is to achieve an
"industry standard" level of strong privacy, capable of protecting
confidential information from inspection or accidental disclosure.
Integrity assurance may be useful in archival and provenance
applications.
