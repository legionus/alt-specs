%description
You use `Tie::Cycle' to go through a list over and over again.
Once you get to the end of the list, you go back to the beginning.
You don't have to worry about any of this since the magic of
tie does that for you.

The tie takes an array reference as its third argument. The tie
should succeed unless the argument is not an array reference.
Previous versions required you to use an array that had more
than one element (what's the pointing of looping otherwise?),
but I've removed that restriction since the number of elements
you want to use may change depending on the situation.

During the tie, this module makes a shallow copy of the array
reference. If the array reference contains references, and those
references are changed after the tie, the elements of the cycle
will change as well. See the included test.pl script for an
example of this effect.
