%description
Read write lock for asyncio . A RWLock maintains a pair of associated
locks, one for read-only operations and one for writing. The read lock
may be held simultaneously by multiple reader tasks, so long as there
are no writers. The write lock is exclusive.

Whether or not a read-write lock will improve performance over the use
of a mutual exclusion lock depends on the frequency that the data is
read compared to being modified. For example, a collection that is
initially populated with data and thereafter infrequently modified,
while being frequently searched is an ideal candidate for the use of a
read-write lock. However, if updates become frequent then the data
spends most of its time being exclusively locked and there is little, if
any increase in concurrency.
