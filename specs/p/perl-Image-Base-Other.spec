%description
`Image::Base::Text' extends `Image::Base' to create or update text files
treated as grids of characters, or just to create a grid of characters in
memory.

Colours for drawing can be a single character to set in the image, or
there's an experimental `-colour_to_character' attribute to map names to
characters.  Currently black, #000000, #000000000000 and clear all become
spaces and anything else becomes a "*".  Perhaps that will
change.

Perl wide characters can be used, in new enough Perl, though currently
there's nothing to set input or output encoding for file read/write (making
it fairly useless, unless perhaps you've got global PerlIO layers setup).
