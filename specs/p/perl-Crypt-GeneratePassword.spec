%description
Crypt::GeneratePassword generates random passwords that are
(more or less) pronounceable. Unlike Crypt::RandPasswd, it
doesn't use the FIPS-181 NIST standard, which is proven to be
insecure. It does use a similar interface, so it should be a
drop-in replacement in most cases.

If you want to use passwords from a different language than english,
you can use one of the packaged alternate unit tables or generate
your own. See below for details.

For details on why FIPS-181 is insecure and why the solution
used in this module is reasonably secure, see "A New Attack on
Random Pronounceable Password Generators" by Ravi Ganesan and
Chris Davies, available online in may places - use your
favourite search engine.

This module improves on FIPS-181 using a true random selection with
the word generator as mere filter. Other improvements are
better pronounceability using third order approximation instead
of second order and multi-language support.
Drawback of this method is that it is usually slower. Then again,
computer speed has improved a little since 1977.
