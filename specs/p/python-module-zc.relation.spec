%description
The relation catalog can be used to optimize intransitive and transitive
searches for N-ary relations of finite, preset dimensions.

For example, you can index simple two-way relations, like employee to
supervisor; RDF-style triples of subject-predicate-object; and more
complex relations such as subject-predicate-object with context and
state. These can be searched with variable definitions of transitive
behavior.

The catalog can be used in the ZODB or standalone. It is a generic,
relatively policy-free tool.

It is expected to be used usually as an engine for more specialized and
constrained tools and APIs. Three such tools are zc.relationship
containers, plone.relations containers, and zc.vault. The documents in
the package, including this one, describe other possible uses.
