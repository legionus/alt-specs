%description
Module::Versions handles versions of loaded modules with a flexible result
interface. The main goal is to get as much version informations as possible
about a module or module list with a simple call interface and an absolutely
flexible result interface. Module::Versions handles *loaded* and *loadable*
modules.

The motivation for writing this module was the need for better support
facilities to get  informations about the used modules and versions in the
productivity environment. Module::Versions allows shipping applications
basically with something like a '-version' option (See the Getopt::Long manpage) but
with expanded functions.

Module::Versions tries to read the loaded/loadable module's $VERSION. For
extended purposes any private project 'version variables' can be fetched
($_VERSION, $version, $REV, etc.).

Module::Versions has a flexible result interface to satisfy different needs:
results can be lists and data structures with different formats - pre-formed
ARRAY, HASH, SCALAR, CSV, XML/XSD/DTD and a full flexible user callback
interface.

*It is for example very simple to print a good formatted version list to the
console and save a version.xml file (in conjunction with an xsd-schema) at
the same time with an absolutely minimum of coding (the SYNOPSIS manpage, Pretty
Compact) *.

Module::Versions tries to load 'version.pm' to support Perl 5.10.0's $VERSION
formatting.
