%description
This is a Python re-implementation of the libmacaroons C library.
Macaroons, like cookies, are a form of bearer credential. Unlike
opaque tokens, macaroons embed caveats that define specific authorization
requirements for the target service, the service that issued the root macaroon
and which is capable of verifying the integrity of macaroons it receives.

Macaroons allow for delegation and attenuation of authorization. They are
simple and fast to verify, and decouple authorization policy from the
enforcement of that policy.
