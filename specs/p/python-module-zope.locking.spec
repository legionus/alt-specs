%description
The zope.locking package provides three main features:

  * advisory exclusive locks for individual objects;
  * advisory shared locks for individual objects; and
  * frozen objects (locked to no one).

Locks and freezes by themselves are advisory tokens and inherently
meaningless. They must be given meaning by other software, such as a
security policy.
