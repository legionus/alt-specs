%description
ZODB storages typically store multiple object revisions to support
features such as multi-version concurrency control and undo.  In the
case of the mod popular storage implementation, old revisions aren't
discarded until a pack.  This feature has often been exploited to
perform time travel, allowing one to look at a database as it existed
in at some point in time.  In the past, this has been possible with
file storage by specifying a time at which to open the file
storage. This works fairly well, but is very slow for large databases
because existing index files can't easily be used.  Time travel is
also supported for individual objects through the ZODB history
mechanism.
