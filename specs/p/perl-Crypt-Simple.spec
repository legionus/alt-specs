%description
Maybe you have a web application and you need to store some session data at the
client side (in a cookie or hidden form fields) but you don't want the user to
be able to mess with the data.  Maybe you want to save secret information to a
text file.  Maybe you have better ideas of what to do with encrypted stuff!

This little module will convert all your data into nice base64 text that you
can save in a text file, send in an email, store in a cookie or web page, or
bounce around the Net.  The data you encrypt can be as simple or as complicated
as you like.
