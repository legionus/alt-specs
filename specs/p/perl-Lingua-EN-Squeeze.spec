%description
Squeeze english text to most compact format possible so that it is barely
readable. Be sure to convert all text to lowercase before using the
SqueezeText() for maximum compression, because optimizations have been
designed mostly for uncapitalized letters.

"Warning: Each line is processed multiple times, so prepare for slow
conversion time"

You can use this module e.g. to preprocess text before it is sent to
electronic media that has some maximum text size limit. For example pagers
have an arbitrary text size limit, typically around 200 characters, which
you want to fill as much as possible. Alternatively you may have GSM
cellular phone which is capable of receiving Short Messages (SMS), whose
message size limit is 160 characters. For demonstration of this module's
SqueezeText() function, this paragraph's conversion result is presented
below. See yourself if it's readable (Yes, it takes some time to get used
to). The compression ratio is typically 30-40%%.
