well-developed component architecture. PyUtilib has been developed to
support several Python projects under development at Sandia National
Laboratories, including  Coopr and  FAST.

This Python package includes a simple workflow management system.  This
is inspired by other open-source workflow tools, such as pyphant and
spiffworkflow.  What distinguished pyutilib.workflow is that it is
not strongly dependent on the datatypes being managed (e.g. the use of
scipy or numpy types).  Also, pyutilib.workflow is designed to support
Python-level definitions of the workflow (rather than a separate XML
specification).

%description -n python3-module-%oname-autodist
The PyUtilib project supports the development of an ensemble of Python
packages that include a wide variety of utilities, including a
well-developed component architecture. PyUtilib has been developed to
support several Python projects under development at Sandia National
Laboratories, including  Coopr and  FAST.

This Python package includes commonly used PyUtilib definitions and
commands.  For example, this package includes PyUtilib-specific
exception definitions.
