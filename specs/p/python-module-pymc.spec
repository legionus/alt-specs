%description
Bayesian estimation, particularly using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC),
is an increasingly relevant approach to statistical estimation. However,
few statistical software packages implement MCMC samplers, and they are
non-trivial to code by hand. pymc is a python package that implements
the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm as a python class, and is extremely
flexible and applicable to a large suite of problems. pymc includes
methods for summarizing output, plotting, goodness-of-fit and
convergence diagnostics.
