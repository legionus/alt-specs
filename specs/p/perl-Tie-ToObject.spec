%description
While "tie" in perldoc allows tying to an arbitrary object, the class in question
must support this in it's implementation of "TIEHASH", "TIEARRAY" or
whatever.

This class provides a very tie constructor that simply returns the object it
was given as it's first argument.

This way side effects of calling "$object->TIEHASH" are avoided.

This is used in Data::Visitor in order to tie a variable to an already
existing object. This is also useful for cloning, when you want to clone the
internal state object instead of going through the tie interface for that
variable.
