%description
*Net::SFTP* is a pure-Perl implementation of the Secure File
Transfer Protocol (SFTP) - file transfer built on top of the
SSH2 protocol. *Net::SFTP* uses *Net::SSH::Perl* to build a
secure, encrypted tunnel through which files can be transferred
and managed. It provides a subset of the commands listed in
the SSH File Transfer Protocol IETF draft, which can be found
at *http://www.openssh.com/txt/draft-ietf-secsh-filexfer-00.txt*.

SFTP stands for Secure File Transfer Protocol and is a method of
transferring files between machines over a secure, encrypted
connection (as opposed to regular FTP, which functions over an
insecure connection). The security in SFTP comes through its
integration with SSH, which provides an encrypted transport
layer over which the SFTP commands are executed, and over which
files can be transferred. The SFTP protocol defines a client
and a server; only the client, not the server, is implemented
in *Net::SFTP*.

Because it is built upon SSH, SFTP inherits all of the built-in
functionality provided by *Net::SSH::Perl*: encrypted
communications between client and server, multiple supported
authentication methods (eg. password, public key, etc.).
