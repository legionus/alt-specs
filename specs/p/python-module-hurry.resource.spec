%description
Resources are files that are used as resources in the display of a web
page, such as CSS files, Javascript files and images. Resources packaged
together in a directory to be published as such are called a resource
library.

When a resource is included in the head section of a HTML page, we call
this a resource inclusion. An inclusion is of a particular resource in a
particular library. There are two forms of this kind of inclusion in
HTML: javascript is included using the script tag, and CSS (and KSS) are
included using a link tag.

Inclusions may depend on other inclusions. A javascript resource may for
instance be built on top of another javascript resource. This means both
of them should be loaded when the page displays.

Page components may actually require a certain inclusion in order to be
functional. A widget may for instance expect a particular Javascript
library to loaded. We call this an inclusion requirement of the
component.

hurry.resource provides a simple API to specify resource libraries,
inclusion and inclusion requirements.
