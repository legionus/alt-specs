%description
The grampg (cue to Grumpy Admin Password Generator, and pronounced
"grummpeegee") is a small python2 library which allows to generate
passwords according to (possibly complicated) user specs. The idea is
simple: build an instance, feed it your desired specifications, then
generate as many passwords as you want. Each password generated will be
independent of the others, except from the fact that all of them will
comply with the specs.

The objectives for the grampg are flexibility and easy of use. grampg
fulfills by providing a kind interface to the user: When building the
password generator the user writes the spec as if it were being
pronounced. In this fashion, a set of complex rules is expressed in a
declarative line.
