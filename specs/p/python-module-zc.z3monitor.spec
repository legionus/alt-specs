%description
The Zope 3 monitor server is a server that runs in a Zope 3 process and
that provides a command-line interface to request various bits of
information. It is based on zc.monitor, which is itself based on zc.ngi,
so we can use the zc.ngi testing infrastructure to demonstrate it.

This package provides several Zope 3 and ZODB monitoring and
introspection tools that work within the zc.monitor server. These are
demonstrated below.

This package also supports starting a monitor using ZConfig, and
provides a default configure.zcml for registering plugins.
