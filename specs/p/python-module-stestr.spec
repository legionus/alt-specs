%description
stestr is parallel Python test runner designed to execute unittest test suites
using multiple processes to split up execution of a test suite.
It also will store a history of all test runs to help in debugging failures
and optimizing the scheduler to improve speed. To accomplish this goal
it uses the subunit protocol to facilitate streaming and storing results from multiple workers.

stestr originally started as a fork of the testrepository project.
But, instead of being an interface for any test runner that used subunit,
like testrepository, stestr concentrated on being a dedicated test runner for python projects.
While stestr was originally forked from testrepository it is not backwards compatible with testrepository.
At a high level the basic concepts of operation are shared between the two projects but the actual usage is not exactly the same.
