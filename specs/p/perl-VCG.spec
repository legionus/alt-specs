%description
This module provides an interface to to the vcg graphing tool. It supports a
limited selection of options and file formats. The vcg graphing tool homepage
is currently http://rw4.cs.uni-sb.de/users/sander/html/gsvcg1.html but is being actively
developed elsewhere.

This module is based on Leon Brocard's GraphViz module, it tries
to provide a similar interface to offer some sense of consistency.

VCG is now in active development and although Graph::Writer::VCG already exists,
this module provides a similar interface to graphviz and will be more closely tied
into vcg as it becomes more actively developed - see James Micheal DuPont's announcement
at http://mail.gnome.org/archives/dia-list/2003-February/msg00029.html.
