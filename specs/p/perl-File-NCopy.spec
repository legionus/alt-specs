%description
File::NCopy::copy copies files to directories, or a single file to
another file.  You can also use a reference to a file handle if you wish
whem doing a file to file copy.  The functionality is very similar to
cp.  If the argument is a directory to directory copy and the
recursive flag is set then it is done recursively like cp -R.
In fact it behaves like cp on Unix for the most part.
If called in array context, an array of successful copies is returned,
otherwise the number of succesful copies is returned.  If passed a file
handle, it's difficult to make sure the file we are copying isn't the
same that we are copying to, since by opening the file in write mode it
gets pooched.  To avoid this use file names instead, if at all possible,
especially for the to file.  If passed a file handle, it is not closed
when copy returns, files opened by copy are closed.
