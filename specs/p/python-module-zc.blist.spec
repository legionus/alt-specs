%description
The sequence in this package has a list-like API, but stores its values
in individual buckets. This means that, for small changes in large
sequences, the sequence could be a big win. For instance, an ordered
BTree-based container might want to store order in a sequence, so that
moves only cause a bucket or two--around 50 strings or less--to be
rewritten in the database, rather than the entire contents (which might
be thousands of strings, for instance).
