%description
Caching of web pages is a complicated process: there are many possible
policies to choose from, and the right policy can depend on factors such
as who is making the request, the URL is being retrieved and resource
negotiation settings such as accepted languages and encodings.

Hardcoding caching logic in an application is not desirable, especially
for reusable code. It is also not possible to allow an administrator to
manually configure the caching headers for every resource in an
application. This packages tries to address this problem by providing a
cache ruleset framework: it allows implementors to specify a ruleset for
every component. Administrators can then define a policy which dictates
the correct caching behaviour for each ruleset.
