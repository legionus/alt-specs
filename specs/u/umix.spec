%description
Umix is a program for adjusting soundcard volumes and other
features in soundcard mixers. You can control your volumes, balances and
recording sources flexibly from the command line or with a ncurses
user interface with familiar vi/emacs keybindings. Umix supports multiple 
mixer devices. All settings can be saved and loaded from a file.

Unfortunately, Umix can not operate with ALSA, only with OSS.
Modprobe snd-mixer-oss for OSS mixer support.
