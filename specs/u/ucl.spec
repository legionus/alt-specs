%description
UCL implements a number of algorithms with the following features:
- Decompression is simple and *very* fast.
- Requires no memory for decompression.
- The decompressors can be squeezed into less than 200 bytes of code.
- Focuses on compression levels for generating pre-compressed data which
  achieve a quite competitive compression ratio.
- Allows you to dial up extra compression at a speed cost in the compressor.
  The speed of the decompressor is not reduced.
- Algorithm is thread safe.
- Algorithm is lossless.
UCL supports in-place decompression.
