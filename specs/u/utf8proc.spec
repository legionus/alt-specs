%description -n lib%name
utf8proc is a library for processing UTF-8 encoded Unicode strings.
Some features are Unicode normalization, stripping of default ignorable
characters, case folding and detection of grapheme cluster boundaries.
A special character mapping is available, which converts for example
the characters “Hyphen” (U+2010), “Minus” (U+2212) and “Hyphen-Minus
(U+002D, ASCII Minus) all into the ASCII minus sign, to make them
equal for comparisons.

The currently supported Unicode version is 9.0.0.

This package only contains the C library.

%package -n lib%name-devel
Summary: Header files, libraries and development documentation for %name
Group: Development/Other

%description -n lib%name-devel
Contains header files for developing applications that use the %name
library.

The documentation for the C library is found in the utf8proc.h header file.
"utf8proc_map" is most likely the function you will be using for mapping UTF-8
strings, unless you want to allocate memory yourself.
