%description
This version of UAE emulates:

- A 68000, 68010 or 68020 CPU, optionally a 68881 FPU
- OCS Graphics Chipset, plus big blits from the ECS Chipset
- Up to 2MB Chip RAM and up to 8MB Fast RAM, or 8MB Chip RAM without Fast RAM
- Up to 64MB Zorro III Fast RAM, independent of Chip RAM setting (68020 only)
- Up to 1MB Slow RAM, for extended compatibility with problem software
- Up to 8MB of graphics card memory, usable by software that supports
  Picasso 96 compatible graphics cards
- 4 x 3.5" floppy disk drives (DF0:, DF1:, DF2: and DF3:). It's not possible to
  read Amiga disks, so these are emulated with disk files.
- A hard-disk: either a harddisk image file or part of the native filesystem
- Joystick support (with option of mapping joystick to numeric keypad)
- Mouse support
- Ability to run in various screen modes (for better display quality or
  better speed)
- Full stereo sound support, consisting of 4 x 8bit channels
- Beta parallel and serial port support
- some other things which don't work well enough to mention them here...
