%description
Tiled is a general purpose tile map editor. It is meant to be used for
editing maps of any tile-based game, be it an RPG, a platformer or a
Breakout clone. Tiled is very flexible, for example there are no
restrictions on map size, tile size or the number of layers or tiles.
Also, it allows arbitrary properties to be set on the map, its layers,
the tiles or on the objects. Its map format (TMX) is relatively easy to
understand and allows a map to use multiple tilesets while also
allowing each tileset to grow or shrink as necessary later.
