%description
Ted is an easy rich text processor. It can edit RTF files
in a WYSIWYG manner. It supports multiple fonts and can
print to PostScript printers.  Additionally Ted is an rtf2ps,
rtf2pdf, rtf2html and an rtf2epub converter.

Ted consists of a general part: The program, something.afm files
and an American spelling checker. Additional packages with
spell checking dictionaries for different languages exist.

This package is the general part.
