%description
ANOVA, or Analysis of Variance, is a method for comparing levels of some
continuous response variable between different groups. The main idea is
to compare variation within each group to variation between the groups;
if the groups vary considerably from one group to another in comparison
to the within group variation, we can reject the null hypothesis that
all the groups have similar levels of the response variable.
