* Fri Mar 16 2018 Igor Vlasenko <viy@altlinux.ru> 3.0-alt9.1
- NMU: added URL

* Fri Nov 30 2012 Dmitry V. Levin <ldv@altlinux.org> 3.0-alt9
- Disabled telnet-3.0-owl-ipv4-only.patch (closes: #27423).

* Fri Oct 31 2008 Dmitry V. Levin <ldv@altlinux.org> 3.0-alt7
- Use strlcpy from glibc.

* Thu Apr 12 2007 Dmitry V. Levin <ldv@altlinux.org> 3.0-alt6
- Uncompressed tarball, cleaned up specfile.

* Tue Jun 28 2005 Dmitry V. Levin <ldv@altlinux.org> 3.0-alt5
- Fixed compilation warnings.

* Thu Mar 16 2005 Dmitry V. Levin <ldv@altlinux.org> 3.0-alt4
- Synced with 3.0-owl2:
  + Introduced the appropriate bounds checking into slc_add_reply()
    and env_opt_add() (both are in the telnet client only).
  + Improved the environment variable export restrictions such
    that the exportability of DISPLAY and TERM variables may be
    controlled too, updated the man page; this replaced the
    Red Hat Linux derived patch.
  + Resolved a possible truncation of DISPLAY when it is sent
    in response to TELOPT_XDISPLOC.
- Patched to link with libtinfo.

* Mon Jun 16 2003 Stanislav Ievlev <inger@altlinux.ru> 3.0-alt3.1

* Thu Oct 17 2002 Dmitry V. Levin <ldv@altlinux.org> 3.0-alt2
- Added telnetd flow control diagram
  (from Owl CanSecWest/core02 / NordU2002 presentation slides).

* Tue Feb 05 2002 Stanislav Ievlev <inger@altlinux.ru> 3.0-alt1
- adopted for ALT

* Sun Nov 25 2001 Solar Designer <solar@owl.openwall.com>
- Do telnet protocol handling as a dedicated pseudo-user and in a chroot
jail.  This uses the approach introduced by Chris Evans in his NetKit
telnetd patches, but the code is different.
- Send fatal*() messages to syslog (and in some cases only to syslog, not
to the remote end).
- Restricted the telnet client to IPv4 only for now due to a problem with
the glibc getaddrinfo(3) for which no trivial fix exists.  The problem is
that with AF_UNSPEC getaddrinfo(3) would perform DNS lookups for possible
IPv6 addresses even if an IPv4 entry exists in the local /etc/hosts.  See
the thread at:
http://sources.redhat.com/ml/libc-alpha/2001-11/threads.html#00125

* Wed Nov 21 2001 Solar Designer <solar@owl.openwall.com>
- Eliminated even more dead code in telnetd, made it use logwtmp(3)
rather than writing to the files directly (it does that to remove the
records which is redundant with our login; will be disabled once telnetd
is made to run as non-root).
- Deal with long lines in /etc/issue.net correctly.
- Don't fallback to /etc/issue.
- Pass -h to telnetd by default (disables the printing of host-specific
information).
- Added a Red Hat Linux derived patch to the telnet client such that it
permits queries for exported variables only.

* Tue Nov 20 2001 Solar Designer <solar@owl.openwall.com>
- Don't use AI_CANONNAME with getaddrinfo(3) in the telnet client (there's
no longer a reference to ai_canonname in the OpenBSD version of the code).

* Sat Nov 17 2001 Solar Designer <solar@owl.openwall.com>
- Ported the telnet client and server from OpenBSD-current (post-3.0),
reviewing changes made in NetBSD-current, FreeBSD-current, and Linux
NetKit 0.17.
- Filter environment variables in telnetd with a white list (took the
list itself from NetKit), but also use a black list for logging likely
attacks.
- Dropped the "mini inetd" from telnetd.
- Dropped Kerberos-related pieces from the man pages (the telnet stuff
is already bad enough, let's better not add to that).
- Wrote telnetd.xinetd.
- Wrote this spec file, based (sub)package descriptions on Red Hat's.
