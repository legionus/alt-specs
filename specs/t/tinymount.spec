%description
TinyMount is a little GUI tool for mount/unmount devices, using
UDisks.

TinyMount is inspired by internal KDE mounter, but has no dependencies
on KDE libs (but it Qt based, sorry) and can be used with lightweight
window managers like awesome, *boxes, etc. with internal tray support,
or with separate tray applications (like stalonetray) if your manager
doesn't support tray.
