%description
The MIT Photonic-Bands (MPB) package is a free program for computing the
band structures (dispersion relations) and electromagnetic modes of
periodic dielectric structures, on both serial and parallel computers.
It was developed by Steven G. Johnson at MIT along with the Joannopoulos
Ab Initio Physics group.

This program computes definite-frequency eigenstates (harmonic modes) of
Maxwell's equations in periodic dielectric structures for arbitrary
wavevectors, using fully-vectorial and three-dimensional methods. It is
especially designed for the study of photonic crystals (a.k.a. photonic
band-gap materials), but is also applicable to many other problems in
optics, such as waveguides and resonator systems. (For example, it can
solve for the modes of waveguides with arbitrary cross-sections.)
