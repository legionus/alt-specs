%description
Musepack is an audio compression format with a strong emphasis on high
quality. It's not lossless, but it is designed for transparency, so
that you won't be able to hear differences between the original wave
file and the much smaller MPC file.

It is based on the MPEG-1 Layer-2 / MP2 algorithms, but since 1997 it
has rapidly developed and vastly improved and is now at an advanced
stage in which it contains heavily optimized and patentless code.
