%description
This is the fastest Internet port scanner. It can scan the entire Internet in
under 6 minutes, transmitting 10 million packets per second. It produces results
similar to nmap, the most famous port scanner. Internally, it operates more like
scanrand, unicornscan, and ZMap, using asynchronous transmission. The major
difference is that it's faster than these other scanners. In addition, it's more
flexible, allowing arbitrary address ranges and port ranges.
