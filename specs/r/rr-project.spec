%description
rr is a lightweight tool for recording, replaying and debugging execution of
applications (trees of processes and threads). Debugging extends gdb with very
efficient reverse-execution, which in combination with standard gdb/x86
features like hardware data watchpoints, makes debugging much more fun.
