%description
rr is a basic command-line utility designed to retain/recall file
and directory paths.  This is done by treating the filename
itself as a unique key to be referenced by for future rr program
calls.  The purpose of this is to assist the user in shorthand
typing and/or not having to remember arbitrary full paths.
