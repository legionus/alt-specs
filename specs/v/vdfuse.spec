%description
This program presents a virtual disk as a Filesystem in User
Space (FUSE).  The separate partitions appear as block files
Partition1, ... under the mount point.  You can then mount any or
all of the partitions as a Loop Device. If you use the readonly
flag then these files are readonly and the partitions themselves
can only be mounted readonly.

NB: you will need to add "user_allow_other" to /etc/fuse.conf
