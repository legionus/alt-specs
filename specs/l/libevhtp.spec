%description
Libevhtp was created as a replacement API for Libevent's
current HTTP API. The reality of libevent's http interface
is that it was created as a JIT server, meaning the developer
never thought of it being used for creating a full-fledged
HTTP service. Infact I am under the impression that the
libevent http API was designed almost as an example of
what you can do with libevent. It's not Apache in a box,
but more and more developers are attempting to use it as so.
