%description
eCAP is a software interface that allows a network application, such as an HTTP
proxy or an ICAP server, to outsource content analysis and adaptation to a
loadable module. For each applicable protocol message being processed, an
eCAP-enabled host application supplies the message details to the adaptation
module and gets back an adapted message, a "not interested" response, or a "block
this message now!" instruction. These exchanges often include message bodies.
The adaptation module can also exchange meta-information with the host
application to supply additional details such as configuration options, a reason
behind the decision to ignore a message, or a detected virus name.
