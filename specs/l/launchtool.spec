%description
launchtool is a tool that runs a user-supplied command and can supervise its
execution in many ways, such as controlling its environment, blocking signals,
logging its output, changing user and group permissions, limiting resource
usage, restarting it if it fails, running it continuously and turn it into a
daemon.
