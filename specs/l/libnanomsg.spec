%description
nanomsg is a socket library that provides several common communication
patterns. It aims to make the networking layer fast, scalable, and easy
to use. Implemented in C, it works on a wide range of operating systems
with no further dependencies.

The communication patterns, also called "scalability protocols", are
basic blocks for building distributed systems. By combining them you can
create a vast array of distributed applications. The following
scalability protocols are currently available:

PAIR - simple one-to-one communication
BUS - simple many-to-many communication
REQREP - allows to build clusters of stateless services to process user
requests
PUBSUB - distributes messages to large sets of interested subscribers
PIPELINE - aggregates messages from multiple sources and load balances
them among many destinations
SURVEY - allows to query state of multiple applications in a single go
