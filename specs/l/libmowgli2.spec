%description
mowgli is a development framework for C (like GLib), which provides
high performance and highly flexible algorithms. It can be used as a
suppliment to GLib (to add additional functions (dictionaries, hashes),
or replace some of the slow GLib list manipulation functions), or stand
alone. It also provides a powerful hook system and convenient logging
for your code, as well as a high performance block allocator.
