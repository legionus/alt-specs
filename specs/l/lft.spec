%description
LFT, short for Layer Four Traceroute, is a sort of 'traceroute' that
often works much faster (than the commonly-used Van Jacobson method) and
goes through many configurations of packet-filter based firewalls. More
importantly, LFT implements numerous other features including AS number
lookups, loose source routing, netblock name lookups, et al.

WhoB is a likable whois client (see whois(1)) designed to provide
everything a network engineer needs to know about a routed IP
address by typing one line and reading one line. But even so,
it's worth typing a few more lines because WhoB can do lots of
other cool things for you!

- thanks Damir Shayhutdinov (damir@) for looking into this,
  I somehow (mis)remembered there were problems inside...
- spec cleanup (macro abuse and hand-written control scripts instead
  of macro versions, how funny)
- updated Url:
- had to add Serial: as 2.5 is less than 2.31 for RPM
  (but that's the way upstream version numbering goes)
- NB: 2.5 introduces a new packaged tool, "whob"; worth looking at
  for those considering whois output overly noisy
