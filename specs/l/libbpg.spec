%description
BPG (Better Portable Graphics) is a image format whose purpose is to
replace the JPEG image format when quality or file size is an issue. Its
main advantages are:

* High compression ratio. Files are much smaller than JPEG for similar quality.
* Supported by most Web browsers with a small Javascript decoder.
* Based on a subset of the HEVC open video compression standard.
* Supports the same chroma formats as JPEG (grayscale, YCbCr 4:2:0, 4:2:2,
  4:4:4) to reduce the losses during the conversion. An alpha channel is
  supported. The RGB, YCgCo and CMYK color spaces are also supported.
* Native support of 8 to 14 bits per channel for a higher dynamic range.
* Lossless compression is supported.
* Various metadata (such as EXIF, ICC profile, XMP) can be included.
