%description
Qt-based multitab terminal emulator based on QTermWidget.

Initially this project was started as an attempt to create relatively
light and stable terminal emulator application like Konsole or
gnome-terminal but without any dependency from such monsters as KDE or
Gnome. I was looking for such kind of application for a long time but
haven't found anything worth while. That's why when I met QTermWidget
and tried it I was really happy! :) That was exactly what I need.
Actually I didn't pay much effort for its improvement, I've just put it
into tab widget, add basic config and some useful actions. Seems that's
pretty much enough for now.

0.4.0+ is a friendly fork, the original project is still available
at http://qterminal.sourceforge.net/
