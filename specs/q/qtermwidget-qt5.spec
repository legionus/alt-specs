%description
QTermWidget is an opensource project based on KDE Konsole
application. The main goal of this project is to provide
unicode-enabled, embeddable QT5 widget for using as a built-in
console (or terminal emulation widget).

Of course I`m aware about embedding abilities of original
Konsole, but once I had Qt without KDE, and it was a serious
problem.

0.4.0+ is a friendly fork, the original project is still available
at http://qtermwidget.sourceforge.net/
