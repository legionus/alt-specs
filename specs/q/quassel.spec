%description
Quassel IRC is a modern, cross-platform, distributed IRC client based on the Qt4 framework.
Distributed means that one (or multiple) client(s) can attach to and detach from a central
core that stays permanently online -- much like the popular combination of screen and a
text-based IRC client such as WeeChat, and similar to (but much more featureful than) so-called BNCs.
Re-attaching your client will show your IRC session in the same state as you left it in
(plus whatever happened while you were gone), and this even when you re-attach from a different
location. In addition, Quassel IRC can be used like a traditional client, with providing both
client and core functionality in one binary. An optional Beginner's Mode completely hides
this feature, so Quassel IRC can be setup very easily.
