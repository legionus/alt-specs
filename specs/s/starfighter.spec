%description
Project: Starfighter is an old school 2D shoot 'em up. In the game you
take on the role of a rebel pilot called Chris, who is attempting to
overthrow a military corporation called Weapco. Weapco has seized
control of the known universe and currently rules it with an iron fist.
Chris can no longer stand back and watch as millions of people suffer
and die. He steals an experimental craft known as "Firefly" and begins
his mission to fight his way to Sol, freeing key systems along the way.
The game opens with Chris attempting to escape a Weapco patrol that has
intercepted him.
