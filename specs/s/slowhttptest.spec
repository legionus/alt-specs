%description
SlowHTTPTest is a highly configurable tool that simulates some Application
Layer Denial of Service attacks.

It implements most common low-bandwidth Application Layer DoS attacks,
such as slowloris, Slow HTTP POST, Slow Read attack (based on TCP persist
timer exploit) by draining concurrent connections pool, as well as Apache
Range Header attack by causing very significant memory and CPU usage on
the server.
