%description
SolveSpace is a parametric 2d/3d CAD program. Applications include:
* modeling 3d parts - draw with extrudes, revolves, and Boolean
  (union / difference) operations;
* modeling 2d parts - draw the part as a single section, and export DXF,
  PDF, SVG; use 3d assembly to verify fit;
* 3d-printed parts - export the STL or other triangle mesh expected by
  most 3d printers;
* preparing CAM data - export 2d vector art for a waterjet machine or
  laser cutter; or generate STEP or STL, for import into third-party
  CAM software for machining;
* mechanism design - use the constraint solver to simulate planar or
  spatial linkages, with pin, ball, or slide joints;
* plane and solid geometry - replace hand-solved trigonometry and
  spreadsheets with a live dimensioned drawing.
