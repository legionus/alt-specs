Summary: srm (secure rm) is a command-line compatible rm(1) which overwrites file contents before unlinking

BuildPreReq: attr

%description
This is srm, a secure replacement for rm(1). Unlike the standard rm,
it overwrites the data in the target files before unlinking them. This
prevents recovery of the data by examining the raw block device. It
may also help frustrate physical examination of the disk, although
it's unlikely that it completely protects against this type of
recovery.
