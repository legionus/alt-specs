%description
SuperLU_DIST contains a set of subroutines to solve a sparse linear system 
A*X=B. It uses Gaussian elimination with static pivoting (GESP). 
Static pivoting is a technique that combines the numerical stability of
partial pivoting with the scalability of Cholesky (no pivoting),
to run accurately and efficiently on large numbers of processors. 

SuperLU_DIST is a parallel extension to the serial SuperLU library.
It is targeted for the distributed memory parallel machines.
SuperLU_DIST is implemented in ANSI C, and MPI for communications.
Currently, the LU factorization and triangular solution routines,
which are the most time-consuming part of the solution process,
are parallelized. The other routines, such as static pivoting and 
column preordering for sparsity are performed sequentially. 
This "alpha" release contains double-precision real and double-precision
complex data types.
