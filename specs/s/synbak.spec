%description
Synbak is an application designed to unify several backup methods. Synbak
provides a powerful reporting system and a very simple interface for
configuration files.
Synbak is a wrapper for several existing backup programs suppling the
end user with common method for configuration that will manage the
execution logic for every single backup and will give detailed reports
of backups result.

Synbak can make backups using:
- RSync over ssh, rsync daemon, smb and cifs protocols (automount functions)
- Tar archives (tar, tar.gz and tar.bz2)
- Tape devices (using multi loader changer tapes too)
- LDAP databases
- MySQL databases
- Oracle databases
- CD-RW/DVD-RW
- Wget to mirror HTTP/FTP servers
- and more...

Synbak can make reports using:
- Email
- Html pages
- RSS feeds
- and more...

Moreover, if you are a developer and want to contribute,
the modular nature of synbak will allow you to easly write
new backup methods, reports, and translations.
