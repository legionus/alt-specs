%description
Sunfish is a simple, but strong chess engine, written in Python, mostly for
teaching purposes. Without tables and its simple interface, it takes up
just 111 lines of code!
Because Sunfish is small and strives to be simple, the code provides a great
platform for experimenting. People have used it for testing parallel search
algorithms, experimenting with evaluation functions, and developing
deep learning chess programs. Fork it today and see what you can do!
