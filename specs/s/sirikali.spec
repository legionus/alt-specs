%description
SiriKali is a Qt/C++ GUI application that manages ecryptfs,cryfs,encfs,gocryptfs and securefs based encrypted folders.
ecryptfs-simple binary application is required to be installed for SiriKali to gain support for ecryptfs volumes.

cryfs binary application is required to be installed for SiriKali to gain support for cryfs volumes.
