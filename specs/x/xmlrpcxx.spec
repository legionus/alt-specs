%description
XmlRpc++ is a C++ implementation of the XML-RPC protocol. It is based
upon Shilad Sen's excellent py-xmlrpc. The XmlRpc protocol was designed
to make remote procedure calls easy: it encodes data in a simple XML
format and uses HTTP for communication. XmlRpc++ is designed to make it
easy to incorporate XML-RPC client and server support into C++
applications.
