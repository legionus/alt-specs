%description
Krename is a very powerful batch file renamer for KDE5 which can rename a list
of files based on a set of expressions. It can copy/move the files to another
directory or simply rename the input files. Krename supports many conversion
operations, including conversion of a filename to lowercase or to uppercase,
conversion of the first letter of every word to uppercase, adding numbers to
filenames, finding and replacing parts of the filename, and many more.
It can also change access and modification dates, permissions, and file ownership.
