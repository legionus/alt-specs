%description
Keychain is a manager for OpenSSH, ssh.com, Sun SSH and GnuPG agents.
It acts as a front-end to the agents, allowing you to easily have one
long-running agent process per system, rather than per login session.
This dramatically reduces the number of times you need to enter your
passphrase from once per new login session to once every time your
local machine is rebooted.
