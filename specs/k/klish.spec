%description libclish
The klish is a framework for implementing a CISCO-like CLI on a UNIX
systems. It is configurable by XML files. The KLISH stands for Kommand
Line Interface Shell.

This package contains the clish "CLI Shell" library.

The library provides the core functionality for a shell to implement a 
CISCO-like user interface. The look and feel is fully defined by a set of
XML files which are loaded when the shell starts up.

The schema for these XML files can be found in 

http://clish.sourceforge.net/XMLSchema/clish.xsd

and in the %name-doc package.

%description liblub
The klish is a framework for implementing a CISCO-like CLI on a UNIX
systems. It is configurable by XML files. The KLISH stands for Kommand
Line Interface Shell.

This package contains the "Little Useful Bits" library. Is is a general
purpose library of small utilities. The design and implementation are
intended for embedded devices, ie. minimise footprint and maximise
performance.

%description libtinyrl
The klish is a framework for implementing a CISCO-like CLI on a UNIX
systems. It is configurable by XML files. The KLISH stands for Kommand
Line Interface Shell.

This package contains the "Tiny Readline" library.

The library provides a simple replacement of the "readline" functionality.
(The readline interface and implementation has some fundamental flaws when
it comes to try and run it within a single memory space envrioment.)
