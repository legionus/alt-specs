%description
Fast Expat based Erlang XML parsing and manipulation library,
with a strong focus on XML stream parsing from network.

It supports:
    Full XML structure parsing: Suitable for small but complete XML chunks.
    XML stream parsing: Suitable for large XML document,
    or infinite network XML stream like XMPP.

This module can parse files much faster than built-in module xmerl.
Depending on file complexity and size fxml_stream:parse_element/1
can be 8-18 times faster than calling xmerl_scan:string/2.

This application was previously called p1_xml and was renamed
after major optimisations to put emphasis on the fact it is damn fast.
