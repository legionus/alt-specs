%description
withlock is a locking wrapper script to make sure that some program
isn't run more than once. It is ideal to prevent periodic jobs spawned
by cron from stacking up.
The locks created are valid only while the wrapper is running, and
thus will never require additional cleanup, even after a reboot. This
makes the wrapper safe and easy to use, and much better than
implementing half-hearted locking within scripts.
