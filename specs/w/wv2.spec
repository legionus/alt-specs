  [mswordview-0.5.2-1]
- Updated to MSWordView-0.5.2
- Changes up to 0.5.2
  * implemented auto text color colour check for table cells, no more
    black on black, or black on blue. i must look closely at what other
    auto changes word makes.
  * some uber-simple greyscaling code when table look says no-color.
  * verified it works under AIX, made a few changes that showed up due
    to its stricter malloc, theres probably a few more malloc related
    issues hiding in there.
  * column breaks show up as well now.
  * the various types of section breaks are distinguisable from the
    others, and from page breaks.
  * a few changes to make sure formatting and tables get on better
    together.
  * sequence field supported, i.e caption numbering, i just use the last
    fields that msword left in there.
  * changed hyperlinking so that it works with bookmarks that are in
    comments (annotations).
  * i now support multiple bookmarks that end on the same location.
  * multiple bookmarks that start on the same location should be supported,
    but no examples yet.
  * the comment author initials are extracted and used in the main document
    when referencing comments.
  * comments now end when they are supposed to, only the correct comments get
    included, should work for fastsave, not tested.
  * removed unused variables, sorted out a few other warnings, maybe itll
    squeak by the irix compiler now ?
  * names and initial info for comments is extracted as well, and stuck in a
    table at the end of the document.
  * fixed the <a name= for comments, should work in fast saved.
  * custom graphics for annotations.
